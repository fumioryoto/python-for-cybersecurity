# Networking in Python for Cybersecurity

Welcome to the Networking in Python for Cybersecurity module! This section covers how to use Python to interact with networks, build network security tools, and analyze network traffic.

## Why Networking Matters for Cybersecurity

Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity. Security professionals need to understand how networks operate to:

- Detect and prevent attacks
- Analyze network traffic for anomalies
- Build tools for network defense
- Penetrate networks ethically
- Monitor network activity

## Topics Covered

1. **Socket Programming**: TCP/UDP sockets for communication
2. **Network Scanning**: Port scanning, banner grabbing, service detection
3. **Packet Capture**: Using scapy to capture and analyze packets
4. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Working with web protocols
5. **DNS Operations**: DNS querying and manipulation
6. **Wireless Networks**: Wi-Fi scanning and monitoring
7. **Network Sniffing**: Capturing and analyzing network packets
8. **Packet Forgery**: Creating and sending custom packets

## Common Use Cases

- **Port Scanning**: Identifying open ports on target systems
- **Packet Analysis**: Examining network traffic for suspicious activity
- **Network Sniffing**: Monitoring network communication
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Testing web applications
- **DNS Spoofing**: Manipulating DNS responses
- **Wireless Network Analysis**: Scanning for Wi-Fi networks and devices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create custom network security tools
- Analyze network packets for security purposes
- Detect network anomalies and attacks
- Interact with network protocols programmatically
- Build tools for ethical hacking and penetration testing

## Getting Started

Start with the basic socket programming examples and work your way up to more advanced topics. Make sure to test your tools in a controlled environment!
