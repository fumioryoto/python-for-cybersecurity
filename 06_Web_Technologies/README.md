- **API Client**: Interacts with RESTful APIs for data collection
- **Web Vulnerability Scanner**: Detects common web vulnerabilities
- **Password Breach Checker**: Verifies if passwords appear in breach databases

Each file contains:

- Detailed comments explaining the code
- Cybersecurity use cases
- Best practices and considerations
- Complete examples with outputs

## Ethical Considerations

When working with web technologies and security testing:

1. **Always obtain permission**: Only test systems you own or have explicit authorization to test
2. **Respect robots.txt**: Adhere to website crawling policies
3. **Rate limiting**: Implement proper delays to avoid overloading servers
4. **Legal compliance**: Ensure your activities comply with local laws
