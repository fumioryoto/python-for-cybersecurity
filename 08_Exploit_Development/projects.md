## Ethical Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** All projects should only be conducted on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Always adhere to:

1. **Scope:** Only test within agreed boundaries
2. **Permissions:** Obtain written authorization before any testing
3. **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of all testing
4. **Responsibility:** Immediately report any vulnerabilities found
5. **Legal:** Understand and comply with local laws and regulations
